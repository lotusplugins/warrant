## Features

- **Warnings, kicks, mutes and bans.** Mutes and bans can be permanent or temporary (`/tempmute`, `/tempban`).
- **IP bans.** Ban an address directly or through a player's last known IP; everyone connecting from it is refused.
- **Punishment history.** Every punishment is recorded, including revoked and expired ones.
- **Silent mode.** Add `-s` / `--silent` to any command so only staff with `warrant.notify` see the announcement.
- **Offline targets.** Ban, mute or warn players who aren't online. Warnings are delivered the next time they join.
- **Mute command blocking.** Muted players can't use private-message commands like `/msg`, `/tell` or `/r`.
- **MiniMessage formatting.** Every message lives in a language file and can be restyled.
- **Developer API.** Cancellable events fire whenever a punishment is issued or revoked.

## Requirements

| Component | Version              |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Server    | Spigot / Paper 26.2+ |
| Java      | 25 or newer          |

## Installation

1. Download the latest jar from the [releases page](https://github.com/lotusplugins/warrant/releases), or [build it yourself](#building-from-source).
2. Drop it into your server's `plugins/` folder.
3. Start the server. `config.yml`, `lang/en_US.yml` and the H2 database (`warrant.mv.db`) are created in `plugins/Warrant/`.

## Commands

`<player>` accepts online and offline players (except `/kick`, which needs an online player). `[reason]` is optional unless noted. Every command accepts `-s` / `--silent`.

| Command                                  | Description                                    | Permission                |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|

| `/mute <player> [reason]`                | Permanently mute a player                      | `warrant.mute`        |
| `/tempmute <player> <duration> [reason]` | Mute a player for a set time                   | `warrant.tempmute`    |
| `/unmute <player> [reason]`              | Lift an active mute                            | `warrant.unmute`      |
| `/ban <player> [reason]`                 | Permanently ban a player                       | `warrant.ban`         |
| `/tempban <player> <duration> [reason]`  | Ban a player for a set time                    | `warrant.tempban`     |
| `/unban <player> [reason]`               | Lift an active ban                             | `warrant.unban`       |
| `/ipban <player\|ip> [reason]`            | Ban an IP address, or a player's last IP       | `warrant.ipban`       |
| `/tempipban <player\|ip> <duration> [reason]` | Ban an IP address for a set time           | `warrant.tempipban`   |
| `/unipban <player\|ip> [reason]`          | Lift an active IP ban                          | `warrant.unipban`     |
| `/punish history <player>`               | View a player's punishment history             | `warrant.history`     |

### Durations

Durations combine a number with a unit: `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), `h` (hours), `d` (days) and `w` (weeks). Units can be chained.

```
/tempban Steve 7d Griefing spawn
/tempmute Alex 1h30m Spamming chat
/ban Herobrine -s Ban evasion
```

### Other permissions

| Permission           | Description                                                    |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `warrant.notify` | See announcements for silent punishments                       |
| `warrant.exempt` | Can't be punished (server operators are always exempt)         |

## Configuration

### `config.yml`

```yaml
# Language file to load from plugins/Warrant/lang/
language: en_US

mute:
  # Commands muted players are not allowed to use
  blocked-commands:
    - msg
    - tell
    - w
    - whisper
    - r
    - reply
    - me
    - teammsg
```

### Messages

All messages live in `lang/<language>.yml` and use [MiniMessage](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html) formatting. Keys missing from a custom language file fall back to the bundled `en_US.yml`.

```yaml
ban:
  announce: "<red><name> was banned by <staff> for <duration>: <reason>"
  screen: "<red>You are banned for <remaining><newline><gray><reason>"
```

| Placeholder   | Meaning                                         |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `<name>`      | The punished player                             |
| `<staff>`     | The staff member (or console) issuing the action |
| `<reason>`    | The reason, or the `no-reason` message          |
| `<duration>`  | The full punishment length                      |
| `<remaining>` | Time left on an active mute or ban              |
| `<id>`        | The punishment's unique ID                      |

## Developer API

Listen for `PlayerPunishedEvent` and `PlayerPunishmentRevokedEvent` to react to punishments, or cancel them before they're saved.

```java
import com.lotusplugins.warrant.api.events.PlayerPunishedEvent;
import com.lotusplugins.warrant.api.model.PunishmentType;
import org.bukkit.event.EventHandler;
import org.bukkit.event.Listener;

public final class PunishmentLogger implements Listener {

    @EventHandler
    public void onPunish(PlayerPunishedEvent event) {
        var punishment = event.getPunishment();
        if (punishment.type() == PunishmentType.BAN && punishment.reason() == null) {
            event.setCancelled(true); // require a reason for bans
        }
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Commands run asynchronously, so these events usually fire off the main thread. Don't touch the Bukkit world directly from your listener.

## Building from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lotusplugins/warrant.git
cd warrant
./gradlew shadowJar
```

The plugin jar is written to `build/libs/`.

| Task                 | Description                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `./gradlew test`      | Run the JUnit test suite                         |
| `./gradlew runServer` | Start a local 26.2 test server with the plugin (needs Java 25) |
