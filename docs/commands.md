`<player>` accepts online and offline players, except `/kick`, which needs an online player. `[reason]` is optional unless noted.

## Silent mode

Add `-s` or `--silent` to any punishment command. The announcement is then only shown to staff with `warrant.notify`.

```
/ban Herobrine -s Ban evasion
```

## Durations

A duration is a number followed by a unit. Units can be chained.

| Unit | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `s`  | seconds |
| `m`  | minutes |
| `h`  | hours   |
| `d`  | days    |
| `w`  | weeks   |

```
/tempban Steve 7d Griefing spawn
/tempmute Alex 1h30m Spamming chat
```

## History

`/punish history <player> [page]` lists every punishment for a player, including expired and revoked ones. Hover an entry for the issuer, duration and revocation details.

Use `--type` or `-t` to filter by `warn`, `kick`, `mute` or `ban`:

```
/punish history Steve 2 --type ban
```

The page size is set by `history.page-size` in the [configuration](../configuration/).

## Importing

`/punish import <source> [--dry-run]` can only be run from the console. See [Importing](../importing/).
