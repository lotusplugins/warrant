## Groups

Most servers only need these three groups.

| Permission              | Includes                                                                           |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `warrant.moderator` | mute, tempmute, unmute, warn, unwarn, kick, history and notify                     |
| `warrant.admin`     | everything in moderator, plus ban, tempban, unban, IP bans and import                       |
| `warrant.*`         | everything in admin, plus `warrant.exempt`                                     |

## Exemption

Players with `warrant.exempt` cannot be punished. Operators are not exempt automatically, so grant the permission explicitly to anyone who should be protected.

The check also works for offline players when LuckPerms or Vault is installed.
